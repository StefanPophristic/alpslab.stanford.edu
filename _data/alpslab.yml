          Chantal completed her undergraduate degree in Linguistics at the University of Ottawa, and her Master’s degree in Linguistics at York University. She is primarily interested in the social uses of language in interaction, exploring how speakers make use of linguistic variation to construct meaning, including possible constraints imposed by context, and how listeners interpret these linguistic moves.

          Elisa is a first year graduate student in the Linguistics department. She uses psycholinguistic experiments and computational models to understand the principles that underlie language use - for example, in the production of referential expressions. Elisa received her Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science at Osnabrueck University.

          Daisy did her undergraduate degree in Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, and her Master’s degree in Language and Cognition at King’s College London. As a PhD student in Stanford Linguistics, she’s interested in how social, pragmatic, and cognitive factors shape language use in interaction: how listeners use social and linguistic cues to construct interpretations of speakers and meaning in comprehension.

          Ciyang did his undergrad in Information and Computing Science at Peking University and MSc in Logic at ILLC, University of Amsterdam. He is interested in natural language semantics and pragmatics, and uses computational and experimental methods to study phenomena such as vagueness and context sensitivity.

          Sebastian got his BSc in Computer Science at the University of Vienna and his MSc in Computer Science at Stanford. He is interested in the language learning processes of adults and children and he studies how adults adapt to speaker idiosyncrasies. He also occasionally uses insights from formal linguistics to design multilingual sentence representations and build better natural language understanding systems.
