      bio:
        - >
          Very broadly, I'm interested in studying the role of emotions in
          the context of decision making and how that plays into our intuitive
          theories of (ourselves and) other people, via computational modeling
          and behavioral experiments.
        - >
          I'm also interested in prosociality, social cognition and theory of
          mind; behavioral and neuro-economics, game theory; artificial
          intelligence.
